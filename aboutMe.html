        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>When I was a kid, I thought technology was magic â€“ the way
          code on a computer could transform into real world experiences
          was inspirational to me. At first, I learned java and python to
          work with robots and make some of my favorite (albeit simplest)
          projects. More recently, I've been interested in webdesign, but
          building this website (it's the first time I've spent this much
          time into designing a website) has made me realize how empowering
          it is to see ideas in your head coming to life, and available for
          anyone to view at the click of a button. That's why I'm excited
          to work with DALI!
