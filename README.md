# The Inspiration
This is my first website built from scratch! I first fell in love with programming when my brother open the inspect tab element and show me the code behind my favorite game (to help me get beat the pesky level I was stuck on). Seeing that code could transform into a game accessible on the internet for anyone to play was something magical for me, and ever since that moment I've been trying to teach myself code. I ended up learning python and java to tinker with RaspberryPi and arduino projects and eventually robotics in highschool. The best part of it is that every time I finish a project, I relive the experience of whimsy and joy I had as a child — seeing ideas turn to reality truly is amazing.

# The Result
Creating this website, I've finally reconnected with a portion of that initial experience that hooked me into this world of programming — the wonders of creating a website that is accessible to everyone over the internet. I hope you like it!

# Future Changes
There are 2 major improvements I'd like to make:
/*:
  1. Making the design responsive so that it scales appropriately for different sized screens (hopefully you're looking at this website fullscreen on a 13" screen)
  2. Improving the design! Adding more pictures, animations, and design choices to make the website even more personal.
